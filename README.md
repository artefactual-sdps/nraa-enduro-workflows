# nraa-enduro-workflows

Enduro child workflows template repository. This project is a basic
preprocessing child workflow example and a template for new Enduro child
workflow projects.

- [Local environment](#local-environment)
- [Makefile](#makefile)

## Configuration

The required configuration for the default `nraa-enduro-worker`:

```toml
debug = false
verbosity = 0
sharedPath = "/home/enduro/shared"

[temporal]
address = "temporal-frontend.enduro-sdps:7233"
namespace = "default"
taskQueue = "preprocessing"
workflowName = "preprocessing"

[worker]
maxConcurrentSessions = 1
```

Optional BagIt bag configuration:

```toml
[bagit]
checksumAlgorithm = "sha512"
```

### Enduro

The child workflow section for Enduro's configuration:

```toml
[[childWorkflows]]
type = "preprocessing"
namespace = "default"
taskQueue = "preprocessing"
workflowName = "preprocessing"
extract = false
sharedPath = "/home/enduro/preprocessing"
```

## Local environment

The supported development workflow is to run `tilt up` from the Enduro
repository and load this repository through Enduro's `CHILD_WORKFLOW_PATHS`
mechanism.

Bring up the Enduro environment by following the [Enduro development manual].

### Set up

The specific requirements for this template are:

- clone this repository as a sibling of the Enduro repository
- configure `CHILD_WORKFLOW_PATHS=../nraa-enduro-workflows`
- configure `MOUNT_PREPROCESSING_VOLUME=true`
- run `tilt up` from the Enduro repository

All other development workflow details, including `.tilt.env`, live updates,
starting, stopping and clearing the environment, are documented in Enduro. This
repository can also provide local overrides through its own `.tilt.env` file,
including settings such as `TRIGGER_MODE_AUTO`.

### Requirements for development

While we run the services inside a Kubernetes cluster we recommend installing Go
and other tools locally to ease the development process.

- [Go] (1.24+)
- GNU [Make] and [GCC]

## Makefile

The Makefile provides developer utility scripts via command line `make` tasks.
Running `make` with no arguments (or `make help`) prints the help message.
Dependencies are downloaded automatically.

### Debug mode

The debug mode produces more output, including the commands executed. E.g.:

```shell
$ make env DBG_MAKEFILE=1
Makefile:10: ***** starting Makefile for goal(s) "env"
Makefile:11: ***** Fri 10 Nov 2023 11:16:16 AM CET
go env
GO111MODULE=''
GOARCH='amd64'
...
```
